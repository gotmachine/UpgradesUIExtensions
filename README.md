# Upgrades UI extensions

This plugin is a collections of user interface tweaks aimed at making the part/module upgrades feature introduced in 1.2 a bit less painful to use for the player :

#### VAB/SPH editor features
- The part stats are now updated according to unlocked upgrades.
- The part cost is now updated according to unlocked upgrades.
- All module widgets now show the updated stats according to unlocked upgrades.
- The part upgrade module widget show the detail of part stats/cost modifiers.
- If "showUpgradesInModuleInfo" (stock field) is set to true the upgrade config, the module widget now show the details of every upgrade currently unlocked for this module
- Some QOL tweaks to the tooltip stats : dry mass, mention of multi-mode engines, better formatting of engines thrust/ISP
- (bonus feature) Non-stock modules using cost/mass modifiers should have their modifiers taken into account too.

#### R&D tech tree feature
- In the nodes part list, upgrades have a pale green background to better differentiate them from parts.

## Disclaimer
I'm far from a skilled programmer, so the code for this may be ugly. As far as I know, it does the job and doesn't break the game. However, keep in mind that *I don't really know what I'm doing*. If anybody has the time to review and comment my code, I'm open to suggestions and pull requests :)

## Licensing
