How to make this work :

List<UpgradePrefab>
  - Part part
  - List<PartUpgrade> partUpgrades
    // PartUpgrade : represent a PARTUPGRADE, like those contained in the stock manager/handler
    // We can get all text info (gui name, description, tech required...) from the manager/handler
    // so no need to replicate it here. 
    - string upgradeName : the upgrade name as defined in the confignode
    - bool partEnabled : is this upgrade enabled for this part (will be checked when instantiating a new part in the editor)
    - List<ModuleUpgrade> moduleUpgrades
      // ModuleUpgrade : represent each modules in the part and the UPGRADE node in this module that correspond to this PARTUPGRADE
      - string module : the name of the module
      - string description : the upgrade description
     - List<UpgradeOverride> overrides
     // UpgradeOverride : represent a combination of a module and a PARTUPGRADE that is disabled by this PARTUPGRADE
     // this is used to manage the "ExclusiveWith__" system : if this PartUpgrade has partEnabled = true AND
     // UpgradeOverride is present for another PartUpgrade's ModuleUpgrade in this UpgradePrefab, this another 
     // PartUpgrade's ModuleUpgrade is greyed out. If ALL these PartUpgrade's ModuleUpgrade are greyed out, the whole 
     // PartUpgrade widget is greyed out and not toggleable. PartStatsUpgradeModule should have its own logic but can rely
     // on the same structure (using the "IsAdditiveUpgrade__" field)
      - string module : the module name
      - string partUpgrade : the partupgrade name
      
Interface :
In the part tooltip, on top of the module list, we add the following :
- Toggle button labelled modules / upgrades, wich the widget list between modules view and upgrades view
- Stock green toggle : is locked green when the part have all its available
  upgrades applied. If not, it is grey, and clicking on it apply all the availablle upgrades. Try to do a tooltip.
- Stock green toggle : same as the first one, but for ALL parts.
