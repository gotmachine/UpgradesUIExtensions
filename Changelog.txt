#### v1.2 for KSP 1.2.2 - 24/03/2017

- The "custom prefabs" parts now try to call OnLoad() on their modules, with the HighLogic.LoadedScene set to LOADING, in an effort to better replicate what happens with the real part prefabs. This fix the issue with Kerbalism custom modules, and may prevent the same kind of error from surfacing in other plugins. Thanks @ShotgunNinja for guidance on what was happening.
- Added some error-checking so if things go wrong, the plugin should fail a bit more gracefully.
